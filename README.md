# Local Chat
Simple app for local chatting on Windows.

Assisting users with remote support sessions requires communication. Chatting on remote access and remote control computer software might not be convenient for some users prompting them to use Notepad or any other text editing software for chatting.

This simple app was made for that purpose using HTML Application (HTA) and VBScript and doesn't require installation or any prerequistes.
